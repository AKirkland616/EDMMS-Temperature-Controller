EDMMS Temp Controller Wishlist 2020-12-09
=========================================

I. General Hardware I/O
	A. One ADC channel configured to measure voltage against the internal 2.5V reference.
	B. One GPIO pin set for input to signal thermocouple polarity.
		- The problem is that thermocouple metallurgy is formulated to reverse the polarity of the thermocouple's signal at the freezing point of water, but one of my applications is to build cryogenic equipment that operates in both positive and negative Celsius. This input will allow the microcontroller to map negative potentials correctly.
		- Note that the polarity on the ADC pin will not actually change; That'll be handled in hardware that is outside the scope of this project.
	C. One GPIO output pin - on or off to control a relay.
	D. One UART peripheral configured for RX and TX, 9600 baud, 8N1 encoding, always on.
	E. None of the programming pins used by the MSP-EXP430G2ET Launchpad are occupied.

II. Notes on implementation
	A. Setpoint and actual temperature should be represented as 16b unsigned values mapping to Kelvins, NOT Celsius or Fahrenheit.
	B. Temperature readings should be debounced. The parameters of the debounce operation should be easily adjusted, at least by recompiling/reflashing.
	C. Avoid floating point data wherever possible. If sub-integer values are needed, fixed-point binary variables are preferable. For instance, in unsigned Kelvin temperatures: 65000+ Kelvins is probably outside the scope of anything we'll ever build in my shop; those variables could assume that the four least significant bits are fractional such that 0x0001 is 0.0625 K and 0x0010 is 1.0 K. This still gives the device a theoretical range of over 4000 K with improved precision.
	D. Ramping - an ideal implementation would include the ability to change the setpoint over time automatically. This is typically handled with a series of steps made up of an interval and a target temperature. If the target temperature differs from the target of the previous step, the setpoint is linearly altered over the interval; if the target temperature is the same, the controller should "soak" at that temperature for the given interval.
	E. If the interval is set for its maximum value, the software should recognize that as a "hold" command and stay at that temperature until given other instructions.
	F. It's fine if there are a fixed number of "program" slots for ramping profiles (4-8 ought to be sufficient) with each program made up of a fixed number of intervals (8 or so should be sufficient). These programs should be stored in the MSP's flash memory so that they are not lost and can be recalled after an interruption in power.
	G. The output pin needs to be configurable so that it understands if being turned on will push the system hotter or colder; I'd like to be able to control either a relay that powers heating elements, or open a cryogenic solenoid valve.

III. UI
	A. UI is handled over the UART peripheral.
	B. Commands can probably be one or two letters followed by a numerical value
	C. Two levels of interactivity
		1. normal - ACK and NAK (ASCII control characters) are sufficient response to commands.
		2. verbose - the interface responds to any command by describing in text what has been done (or explaining that the command is not understood).
	D. Though we may need to use fractional representations of temperatures internally, temperatures are commanded and reported in whole Kelvins.
	E. Setpoint and actual measured temperature are reported at user-defined intervals down to whatever the debounced sampling interval is. 
		- example `.800 k796`
	F. Interacting with the ramping programs can be pretty straightforward. If I command `p1`, the program in slot 1 is loaded and can be run or modified. If I then command `s3`, the third step is loaded. 
	G. `p0` should be a stepless program that just has a setpoint so that the device can be turned on, set to one temperature, and left.
	H. step 0 of any program doesn't have an interval; it's just a start point so that a ramp in step 1 knows where it's starting from. It would be cool if setting to 0 caused step 1 to sample the current temp and start from there, but that's extra.

IV. Commands (partial list):
	- `+` run the currently selected program from the currently selected step
	- `|` pause execution and maintain the current setpoint
	- `-` halt execution and turn the output pin off (maybe this should ask for confirmation)
	- `pN` load program N, step 0
	- `sN` load step N of the current program
	- `.N` set the target setpoint of the current step to N Kelvins (only allowed when execution is halted)
	- `mN` set the interval of the current step in N minutes (only allowed when execution is halted)
	- `v[01]` reset/set verbose mode
	- `rN` set reporting interval to N seconds
